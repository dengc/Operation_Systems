## Intro
-------------------------------------
### Abstraction
execution context
- what you need to execute code, like 'sort()' for object
- represents the state of a process and its threads

examples: 
- files: in disk 
- programs: memory (up-side-down): 上low下high
    - memory map - VM
        - convert Virtual Address to Physical Address
        - part hw, part os
        - each program thinks has own full address space
- threads: virtual processor


-----build an os

Kernel: the portion of the OS that runs in privileged mode

Traps: App calls OS
- means for invoking the kernel from user code
- system calls through which user code can access the kernel in a controlled manner
- for programming errors, the default action is to terminate the user program

Interrupts: External devices call OS
- a request from an external device for a response from the processor
- often has no direct effect on the currently running program

Upcall: OS call App
- A program may establish a handler (i.e., a signal handler) to be invoked in response to the error
- set up a timer

Bus: a collection of signals (address in processor) who connect to each other

Process Control Block (PCB) is a kernel data structure
- has return code & PID
- the "Link" field points to the next PCB

run a program:
- make a copy of a process
- replace the child process with a new one


## Multithreaded Programming
-------------------------------------
### Why

If only one processor, make it look like things are running in parallel
- easier & faster

### Creation
Creating a POSIX Thread
- every thread needs a separate stack
- first stack frame in every child thread corresponds to start_routine

Multiple Arguments
- Be careful how to pass argument to new thread when you call pthread_create()
    - passing address of a local variable only works if we are certain the this storage doesn’t go out of scope until the thread is done with it
    - passing address of a static or a global variable only works if we are certain that only one thread at a time is using the storage
    - passing address of a dynamically allocated storage only works if we can free the storage when, and only when, the thread is finished with it

- To wait for a child thread to die, use pthread_join()

### Termination
- Return Value
- self-terminate
    + return from its "first procedure"
    + pthread_exit: only for this thread (only way for not affecting others)

### Synchronization
avoid Mutual Exclusion
- Atomic operation
    + pthread_mutex_lock()
    + critical section
    + pthread_mutex_unlock()
- multiple locks may cause deadlock
    + Prevention: Lock Hierarchies: must not try locking a mutex at level i if already holding a mutex at equal or higher level
- Guarded Commands
    - evaluting the guard and executing the command sequence altogether is an atomic operation if the guard is true
        - inside one critical section
    - the guard is complicated: keeps changing its value, continuously
        - need condition variables, which is a queue of threads
    - steps:
        1. pthread_cond_wait(cv, mutex)
            - when mutex locked, wait
            - atomically unlocks mutex and wait for the "event"
        2. pthread_cond_broadcast: for all threads; pthread_cond_signal: for one thread
            - for some Readers-Writers 
- Semaphores
    - usually 2 operations
    - can be binary or counting
        - counting: solve the producer-consumer problem
            - if producer is fast and consumer slow, producer may wait
    - looks like mutex
        - diff: one thread performs a P operation on a semaphore, another thread performs a V operation on the same semaphore
- Barriers
    - one thread reaches a barrier, wait until all threads reach, last thread broadcast, then all move forward

### Safety
- can be reentrant
- To suspend your thread for a certain duration

### Deviations
Unix’s signal mechanism
- Signals
    - Ex:  <Cntrl+C>
    - callback/ upcall
    - A signal is pending if it’s generated but blocked, can be delivered if unblocked
- handling signals
    - asynchronously
        - signal handler
            - each signal in a process can have at most one handler
            - sigset(), sigaction()
            - handler() is not async-signal safe
    - synchronously
        - use sigwait()
- masking signals
    - sigset_t
    - if a mask bit is 1, the corresponding signal is blocked
- POSIX Cancellation Rules
    - when pthread_cancel() gets called, the target thread is marked as having a pending cancel, not wait for the cancel to take effect
    - when a thread acts on the cancel, walks through a stack of cleanup handlers


## Context Switching
-------------------------------------
what are we switching -- Execution context, which is the current state of our thread

Context of main(): CPU registers, global var, local var
Context of sub(): global, local var, arguments
Stack frame 从上到下：local var (from callee), ebp, eip, args (from caller)

### Coroutine Linkage
- Threads are independent, but they can be made aware of each other and be able to transfer control from one thread to another
- Switch: To transfer control from one thread to another is equivalent to copying the thread control block of the target thread into the "Current Thread context"

### System Calls
A system call involves the transfer of control from user code to system/kernel code and back
- there is no thread switching!
- Most systems provide threads with two stacks
    - executes in priviledged mode (kernel)
    - it then changed back to a user thread eventually
- Trap into the kernel with all interrupt disabled and processor mode set to privileged mode

### Interrupts
